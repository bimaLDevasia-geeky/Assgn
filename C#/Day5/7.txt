This is the wrong update 

public class emp { 
public string n; public int a; 
public double s; 
public void calc() 
{ 
double x = s * 0.1; 
double y = s + x; 
} 
}


corrected code


//added namespace for avoiding naming conflicts
namespace
{
    // Capitalized the class name for following Convention
    public class Employee
    {
        // added get and set for added encapsulation and made "n" capital
        public string Name { get; set; }

        // added get and set for added encapsulation and made "a" capital
        public int Age {get; set; }

        //added get and set for added encapsulation and made "s" capital
        public double Salary { get; set;}

        //Followed Pascal Cassing
        public void CalculateIncrementedSalary(){

            //followed Camelcassing for private variable
            double bonusAmount = Salary * 0.1;

            //followed Camelcassing for private variable
            double totalSalary = Salary + bonusAmount; 

            //print the output 
            Console.WriteLine("The New Salary is "+ totalSalary);
        }

    }
}
