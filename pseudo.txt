1) Check whether a number is even or odd

    -> if the remainder after dividing the number by 2 is 0 then
        print "the number is even"
    -> else then print "the number is odd"
    
2) Find the largest of three numbers


	-> if first > second and first > third 
       print "first is greatest"
    -> if second > first and second > third
       print "second is greatest"
    -> else print "third is greatest"

3)Display the multiplication table for any number

  -> take the input and store in number
  -> create a loop from 1 to 10
    -> for every iteration do 
        pro = number * iterator
        print number + " * " + iterator + " = " + pro

4)Calculate the sum of first N natural numbers

  -> take the input and store in N
  -> initialize sum = 0
  -> create a loop from 1 to N
    -> for every iteration do 
        sum = sum + iterator
  -> print sum


5)Find the factorial of a number

  -> take the input and store in number
  -> initialize fact = 1
  -> create a loop from 1 to number
    -> for every iteration do
        fact = fact * iterator
  -> print fact

6)Calculate the average and grade of 5 subject marks

  -> take the input of 5 subjects and store in sub1, sub2, sub3, sub4, sub5
  -> total = sub1 + sub2 + sub3 + sub4 + sub5
  -> average = total / 5
  -> if average >= 90 then print "A"
     else if average >= 80 then print "B"
     else if average >= 70 then print "C"
     else if average >= 60 then print "D"
     else print "F"

7)Find the largest and smallest element in an array

    -> take the input of array elements and store in arr
    -> initialize largest = arr[0]
    -> initialize smallest = arr[0]
    -> create a loop from 1 to length of arr
        -> for every iteration do
            if arr[iterator] > largest then
                largest = arr[iterator]
            if arr[iterator] < smallest then
                smallest = arr[iterator]
    -> print largest
    -> print smallest


8)Count how many even and odd numbers are in a list

    -> take the input of list elements and store in lst
    -> initialize even_count = 0
    -> initialize odd_count = 0
    -> create a loop from 0 to length of lst
        -> for every iteration do
            if lst[iterator] % 2 == 0 then
                even_count = even_count + 1
            else
                odd_count = odd_count + 1
    -> print even_count
    -> print odd_count

9)Generate a pattern like a pyramid or triangle

*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *

    -> take the input and store in n
    -> create a loop from 1 to n with iterator i
        -> for every iteration do
            create a  loop from (1 to i )with iterator j
                -> for every iteration do
                    print "* "


10) Find the second largest number in a list

    -> take the input of list elements and store in lst
    -> initialize largest = -infinity
    -> initialize second_largest = -infinity
    -> create a loop from 0 to length of lst
        -> for every iteration do
            if lst[iterator] > largest then
                second_largest = largest
                largest = lst[iterator]
            else if lst[iterator] > second_largest and lst[iterator] != largest then
                second_largest = lst[iterator]
    -> print second_largest


11) Find the sum of diagonal elements in a 2D matrix

    -> take the input of 2D matrix elements and store in matrix
    -> initialize sum = 0
    -> create a loop from 0 to length of matrix with iterator i
        -> for every iteration do
            sum = sum + matrix[i][i]
    -> print sum
